            <p className='text-lg text-gray-600 mt-5'>
                Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate in Management Information Systems at the Robert C. Vackar College of Business and Entrepreneurship, 
                University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, focusing on healthcare information systems. <br />

            <p className='text-lg text-gray-600 mt-8'>
            Through my research, I explore the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and business analytics to address 
            challenges in healthcare and organizational contexts. I am particularly interested in how intelligent systems can enhance healthcare delivery, 
            support chronic disease self-management, and improve decision-making across digital platforms. 
            
            </p>
            <p className='text-lg text-gray-600 mt-8'>
            In addition to clinical decision support, I am deeply interested in digital health 
            interventions that promote mental health self-management. This includes designing and evaluating technologies such as mobile apps and 
            AI-powered assessments that help individuals monitor symptoms, build awareness, and make informed decisions about their health. 
            
            
            </p>
            <p className='text-lg text-gray-600 mt-8'>
            Additionally, I study how AI-driven analytics can support organizational goals such as sustainability, online social movements, 
            ethical governance, and stakeholder engagement. My work bridges technical development with practical application, aiming to build 
            scalable and equitable tools that drive social and business impact. 
            
            </p>
            <p className='text-lg text-gray-600 mt-8'>
            With several years of professional experience in data engineering, business intelligence, and analytics, I bring a practical 
            perspective to my academic work.
