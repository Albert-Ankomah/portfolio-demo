                I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Management Information Systems at the Robert C. Vackar College of Business and Entrepreneurship, 
                University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence, healthcare analytics, 
                and corporate sustainability, with a particular focus on developing computational tools that improve chronic disease management 
                and enhance organizational decision-making.I am particularly interested in how data-driven approaches—ranging from deep learning 
                to social media analytics—can be harnessed to address challenges in healthcare delivery, business performance, and societal 
                well-being.

            <span className='font-bold text-2xl tracking-tighter'>Research Overview</span> 
            <p className='text-gray-600 mt-2'>
            My research explores the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and business analytics to address real-world 
            challenges in healthcare and organizational contexts. I am particularly interested in how intelligent systems can enhance healthcare delivery, 
            support chronic disease self-management, and improve decision-making across digital platforms. A central focus of my work lies in developing 
            data-driven solutions for early detection and progression monitoring of chronic neurological conditions such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s 
            disease. I investigate how longitudinal clinical and behavioral data can be analyzed using AI and ML to improve diagnostic accuracy, 
            personalize care, and empower patients and caregivers.

            <p className='text-gray-600 mt-2'>
            In addition to clinical decision support, I am deeply interested in digital health 
            interventions that promote mental health self-management. This includes designing and evaluating technologies such as mobile apps and 
            AI-powered assessments that help individuals monitor symptoms, build awareness, and make informed decisions about their health. 
            
            
            </p>
            <p className='text-gray-600 mt-2'>
            With several years of professional experience in data engineering, business intelligence, and analytics, I bring a practical 
            perspective to my academic work. My background in building data-driven platforms, optimizing large-scale workflows, and developing 
            predictive systems informs my research, allowing me to connect theoretical innovation with applied impact.  
            
            </p>
            <p className='text-gray-600 mt-2'>
            Beyond healthcare, I study how AI-driven analytics can support organizational goals such as sustainability, online social movements, 
            ethical governance, and stakeholder engagement. My work bridges technical development with practical application, aiming to build 
            scalable and equitable tools that drive social and business impact.
